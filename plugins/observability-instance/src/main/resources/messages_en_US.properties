OS.net.ipv4.tcp_max_tw_buckets.suggestExplain=System at the same time the largest processing timewait number of sockets. If more than this number, the time to wait the socket will be immediately axe and display warning information. To set the limit, in order to resist those simple pure DoS attacks, however, if the conditions need to be more than the default value of the network, you can improve it (perhaps even more memory). (in fact do NAT best can appropriately increase the value)
OS.net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse.suggestExplain=Indicates whether or not allowed to apply in TIME - WAIT state of the socket for the new TCP connection (this to restart some service, quickly and start the prompt after the port is already in use case is helpful)

DB.max_process_memory.suggestExplain=Database node on the numerical need according to the system of physical memory and single node deployment master database nodes is decided. Computation formula is as follows: (physical memory size - vm. Min_free_kbytes) \ * 0.7 / (1 master node number). The coefficient of the purpose is to guarantee the reliability of the system as much as possible, not caused by database memory expansion node OOM. The formula mentioned in the vm min_free_kbytes, its meaning is reserved operating system memory used by the kernel, is often used as a communication transceiver in the operating system kernel memory allocation, at least for 5 \ufffd. Namely, max_process_memory = physical memory * 0.665 / (1) master node number

Should not be greater than 255, the default value is 5, corresponding to the 180 seconds of time.. (for large load and good physical communication network, this value is high, can be changed to 2. This value is only in view of the external connection, the incoming connection, is determined by tcp_retries1)
OS.net.ipv4.tcp_synack_retries.suggestExplain=For remote connection requests the SYN, the kernel sends the SYN + ACK datagram, to confirm a SYN connection request packets received. This is called the three-way handshake (threeway handshake) mechanism of the second step. Here decided to sent by the kernel before giving up connection SYN ACK number. Should not be greater than 255, the default value is 5, corresponding to the 180 seconds of time
OS.net.ipv4.tcp_retries2.suggestExplain=Discarding the activation (communication) has been established in TCP connection, need to how much time before retrying. The default value is 15, according to the RTO value to decide, the equivalent of 13-30 minutes (RFC1122 regulation, must be greater than 100 seconds). (this value according to the current network Settings, can be appropriately changed little, I change to 5) within the network
"OS.vm.overcommit_memory.suggestExplain=Vm. Overcommit_memory file specifies the kernel for memory allocation strategy, its value is 0, 1, 2
0: (default) said the kernel will check whether there is enough memory available supply process; If there is enough memory available, memory applications allow; Otherwise, the memory for failure, and the error is returned to the application process. 0 is heuristic overcommitting handle, will try to reduce the use of the swap, the root can be allocated slightly more memory than the average user
1: the kernel allows allocation of all physical memory, however, the current state of the memory, allowing more than CommitLimit, until run out of memory. On the database server is set to 1, is not recommended to try to avoid using the swap.
2: said not allowed more than CommitLimit values"

Listen in the web application function of backlog will give us the kernel by default parameters of the net. Core. Somaxconn limit to 128, and defined nginx NGX_LISTEN_BACKLOG defaults to 511, it is necessary to adjust this value. On a busy server, increasing the value is helpful to network performance
OS.net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies.suggestExplain=Only when the kernel compilation occurs when chose CONFIG_SYNCOOKIES role. When there is overflow appeared syn waiting queue syncookies like the other sent. The goal is to prevent the syn flood attack
OS.net.core.netdev_max_backlog.suggestExplain=
OS.net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog.suggestExplain=For those who still have not yet received the client confirmation of connection requests, maximum number needs to be saved in the queue. For more than 128 MB of memory system, the default value is 1024, less than 128 MB of 128. If the server is often appear overload, can try to increase the number. Warning! If you see this value is set to greater than 1024, best to modify the include/net/TCP. H TCP_SYNQ_HSIZE inside, to keep TCP_SYNQ_HSIZE * 16 (SYN Flood attack using TCP protocol distribute defects of shaking hands, a false source IP address sends a large number of the TCP SYN - half to open the connection to the target system, eventually leading to the target system Socket queue resources exhausted and can not accept new connections. To cope with this attack, the more widely used in modern Unix systems connected to buffer queue processing way, not to solve this kind of attack, is to use a basic queue processing normal to Connect fully application (the Connect () and the Accept ()), is to use another queue separately store half open the connection. This double queue processing method and some other system kernel measures (such as Syn - Cookies/Caches) joint application, can more effectively relieve small-scale Syn Flood attack (proved)

The file said whether to enable Selective response (Selective Acknowledgment), this can be achieved by selectively response out-of-order receives the message to improve performance (this allows the sender to send only the lost packet). (this option should be enabled for wan communication, but it will add to the CPU
OS.net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps.suggestExplain=Timestamps in other things, can prevent the forgery of sequence number. A 1 g broadband lines may be met with heavy out - of - line numerical old sequence number (if it is due to last time). Timestamp will make it knows this is a 'old packet. Said (the file is enabled in a more accurate than the timeout retransmission method (RFC 1323) to enable the RTT calculation; In order to achieve better performance should enable this option.)
